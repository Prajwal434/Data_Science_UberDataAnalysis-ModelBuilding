### Uber Trips Forecasting Project - Final Report

**Objective:** Predict the number of Uber trips using various regression models.

**Steps Followed:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded dataset and converted 'Date/Time' column to datetime format.
   - Extracted hour, day, and month features for better analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized trip patterns by month, day, and hour.
   - Identified key trends and distributions.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created dummy variables for 'Base' feature.
   - Defined X (features) and y (target).

4. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting** models.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Compared models using **MSE**, **MAE**, and **R²** score.
   - Gradient Boosting provided the most balanced performance.

6. **Final Recommendation:**
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor** is recommended for optimal accuracy and stability.

7. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Improve feature engineering by integrating weather data or traffic information.
   - Explore additional ensemble models for enhanced predictions.

**Conclusion:** This project effectively predicts Uber trips with a strong focus on data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
