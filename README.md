Uber Trip Analysis Machine Learning Project

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to uncover patterns and develop a predictive model for trip demand.  The analysis includes identifying popular pickup times, busiest days, and predicting trip volumes.    

Dataset
The dataset used is Uber's trip data, which contains details like:

Date/Time: When the trip started.    

Pickup Location: Latitude and Longitude.    

Base: TLC base company code.    

The data is available through platforms like Kaggle.    

Steps and Implementation
The project follows these main steps:

Data Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building

Model Evaluation

Visualization    

Implementation Details
The implementation is primarily in Python, using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.    

Key Libraries Used
pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)    

Models
The project uses several machine learning models:

Random Forest Regressor    

XGBoost    

Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor    

Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error

R² Score

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)    

File Structure
