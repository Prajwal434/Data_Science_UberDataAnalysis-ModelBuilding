Uber Trip Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling
📚 Overview
This project delves into Uber's trip data to uncover patterns and build a predictive model for trip demand. By analyzing factors like pickup times, locations, and trip volumes, the goal is to understand ride-sharing dynamics and forecast future demand.

🧠 Problem Statement
Uber's operational efficiency hinges on accurately forecasting trip demand. This analysis aims to identify peak times, popular routes, and other patterns to inform resource allocation and improve service delivery.

🎯 Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and interpret data to uncover trends.

Feature Engineering: Create new variables to enhance model performance.

Model Building: Develop predictive models to forecast trip demand.

Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and reliability.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset, Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv, includes the following columns:

Date/Time: Timestamp of the trip.

Pickup Location: Latitude and Longitude of the pickup point.

Base: TLC base company code.

Note: The dataset is sourced from Uber's publicly available trip data.

🔍 Analysis & Modeling Steps
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert data types, and extract relevant features like hour of day, day of week, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trip patterns, identify peak hours, and analyze trip distributions.

Feature Engineering: Create new features such as trip duration, day part (morning/evening), and categorize pickup locations.

Model Building: Implement machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to predict trip demand.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² to assess model performance.

📈 Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to represent the data effectively:

Time Series Plots: Show trip volumes over time.

Heatmaps: Display trip density across different times and locations.

Bar Charts: Illustrate the distribution of trips by day of week and hour of day.

📄 Final Report
The Uber_Trips_Final_Report.txt provides a comprehensive summary of the analysis, including key findings, model performance, and recommendations for Uber's operational strategies.
